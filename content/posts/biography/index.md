While on Admirals Staff as an Artist I became a "Journalist Third Class" as all staff had to be NCO's (Non Commissioned Officer) and the Journalist rating involved "layouts", the closest discipline to Artist. 
All ratings in the Navy are determined by written tests and are calculated on a curve. 
There is an "Artist" classification in the Navy but it is a "war time only" classification.  

{{< figure src="images/biography/25-Deslant.webp" caption="Com Deslant" lightbox="none" >}}  

We designed and executed portable recruiting and public relations displays and booths.  
Designed and directed construction by Naval personnel a combination of two performance stages and specific decorations commemorating 60 years of US Naval Destroyers. The first Destroyer was commissioned in 1902.  
This ball portrayed the 3 of the liberty ports (San Francisco in 1902, New Orleans in the 20's and New York City 1962) for Destroyers during the 60 years.  
At the request of President John F. Kennedy and the Naval Chief of Staff the decorations traveled to all major naval installations on both the East and West coast including two months at the Seattle World’s Fair.  
Stages and decorations fill a space 200 foot wide by 500 foot long.  
Design took me and nine other men working 10 weeks.  
Did layouts and illustrations for "Destroyerman" Navy monthly magazine and illustrated and layed out 60th Anniversary glossy magazine.  
I did many drawings and illustrations of Navy ships.

### Production Manager Lighting and Design

Paolo Soleri Amphitheater, Santa Fe Indian School

After renovating the venue stage lights, I then designed and built a portable truss concert lighting system specifically for this venue.  
An intimate 1500 seat outdoor amphitheater on the grounds of the Santa Fe Indian School.  
This open-air amphitheater was designed by famed Italian architect, Paolo Soleri, (he designed the port authority bus station at the New York end of the George Washington bridge) he is the founder and principal architect for his community built in the Arizona, high desert.  

Arcosanti is an urban laboratory for alternative human habitat.
He based his design for the amphitheater on ancient Greek amphitheaters. 
It has an elliptical thrust stage (not easy to light).
As a result of the uniqueness of this stage shape, and size, regular rock, and roll concert lighting, rigs did not fit this venue.
There were no "overhead" hanging places for lighting.
My system became the "house concert lighting rig".

#### SWIA First Annual Santa Fe Pow Wow: At the downs Santa Fe

2nd 3rd and 4th Annual Pow Wow at Pojoaque Pueblo Pow Wow Grounds

I lit the evenings dances with PAR 64 1K's with some color and diffusion.
These lights, 6 to a truss, were mounted on 6 "genie lifts" and were sequestered behind the audience bleachers, which in the case of a pow-wow are in a large circle.

When the dancing breaks for dinner, I would surreptitiously crank up the towers one after the other and then turn the lights on so that when the dancers came back from their dinner break and make their "grand entrance," they are illuminated.
I had never seen Native American Pow Wow's lit at night except by bonfires and car headlights (in a circle pointed into the circle of dancers).

Now every year at the "Gathering of Nations" Pow Wow in Albuquerque, they light the Pow Wow with PAR's.
This Pow Wow is in April and is the first each year.
It kicks off Native American Pow Wow's in the U.S.

### QUOTES

* "Recorded hysterical laughter, kaleidoscopic colors and innumerable TV screens are a few of the sights and sounds that make the "Energy Sculpture" of Adrian Guillery and Dick Hogle seem at first like a carefully constructed funhouse.
* The viewer soon learns that it is more of a chamber of horrors: the laughter comes from a monstrous image of a Nazi soldier, while the glad array of colors and television is intended as a caustic comment about contemporary society." Time Magazine, October 8, 1965
* "Hogle has combined his studies in painting and music to produce a creative kinetic art form", Time Magazine, November, 1965
* "Hogle works with flashing colored lights projected onto shaped translucent forms; cubes, cylinders, rectangles, some suitable for out of doors use", Howard Wise Gallery, November, 1967
* "Energy Sculpture, which turns out to be painted objects transfigured by music and colored light, created by Adrian Guillery and Dick Hogle", "Goings on About Town", The New Yorker, November, 1965
* "There is, for instance, a show at the Finch College Museum called Energy Sculpture, which includes the work of two ingenious young artist, Adrian Guillery and Dick Hogle, who worked their way through college as Jazz musicians, and now collaborate on constructions which, at the turn of a switch, jump, jiggle, light up, make ear-splitting noises." "Now Hear This!" Emily Genauer, "Art", New York Herald Tribune, October, 10, 1965
* "Different but just as alive is the show at the Finch College Museum done by two young musician - artists, Adrian Guillery and Dick Hogle! --They have up dated the static social commentary that we'd seen in the 30's and early 40's and made the transition to the 60's utilizing our technical world and making a statement which is ART". West Side News and Morningsider, Oct, 7, 1965
* "Dick Hogle left college in 1960 to fulfill his military obligation in the US Navy, where, after duty in the Mediterranean and the Near East, he was stationed as a staff artist at Newport, Rhode Island.

He re-entered college after completing his enlistment, received his degree from New York University at New Paltz and taught Art after graduation.
His early work was shown in 1960 at a two man show at the New York State University at New Paltz and at the Newport Summer Festival in 1962.
He had a one man show in Washington, D.C.
in 1964 and his "Teeth Box" was included in the 1965 "Box Show" at Byron Gallery.

In the same year his work was also shown in the P.V.I.
Gallery's "Hundred Man Show".
Hogle too, has worked with light, color, and line in making several animated and line films.
In his "Kinetic Sculpture", Hogle combines with the art form his thorough knowledge of music by which he supported himself through college.
Originally concentrating on percussion instruments, he has extended into playing and composing electronic and "Third Stream Music".
This has been combined in collaboration with Guillery into the work now being presented.

* "New light machines by Dick Hogle are currently on view at City College's Bernard M. Baruch School of Business and Public Administration in the Student Center (137 East 22nd Street) October 24th through November 9th, Monday to Friday from 4 to 6 pm.
The works may also be seen at other times by appointment (Mrs. Dorothy Lockwood, or 3-770, extension 311 or 313).
The largest piece, commissioned for the opening of the Abeg Foundation museum in Bern, Switzerland, will have its only American showing at the Baruch School.

The ten pieces on exhibit represent a new departure by Mr. Hogle in the development of shifting light patterns.
"These softly changing shapes make a kind of silent music", Arts Magazine said of an earlier piece of kinetic light sculpture shown last September at the Finch Museum.

* Adrian Guillery and Dick Hogle: Energy Sculpture is the term hit upon by the two artist-musicians to describe the musical, kinetic and brightly painted sculptures that fill the Contemporary Wing of Finch College Museum with a carnival atmosphere.
Adrian Guillery and Dick Hogle are celebrating the invention of television, teeth, TV Dinners and, most of all, moving light and color patterns.
There is a Pop-ish air to many of the pieces, and to their fun titles, which happily, are witty, descriptive comments on the works themselves.

Among the twenty three works are Dilemma of the Silver Savior, Black Teeth Box, Man Watching Happiness Machine and Red and White Check TV Dinner - not all of them wired for sound.
Dick Hogle's small silent pieces include a series of boxes and TV dinners; the latter, which are the size and shape of the original supermarket products, take off from there.
In the course of the exhibition, these dinners evolve into plastic light paintings which echo the more romantic type of Abstract Expressionism of the mid-fifties.

A Pentagon Cloud Box set apart in an alcove of the gallery is perhaps the most aesthetically successful of the silent works.
Each of the five visible surfaces of the box has a cut-out translucent circle through which the viewer can watch the dissolving forms of a set of floating light patterns.
These softly changing shapes make a kind of silent music.
The Cloud Box, as do all the other pieces involving light patterns owe to Lumia (at the Museum of Modern Art), the first work to organize moving light patterns as a visual experience.
However, light patterns are only one element in the Guillery-Hogle works.

There are the sculptural box shapes themselves and, in the larger pieces, the assemblage of painted, kinetic sculptures, equipped with the artists specially created sound.
In Man Watching Happiness Machine, a hard edge blue-and-white-check TV set stands on a piece of patterned, checked floor opposite a matching box "receiver".

The programmed set of light patterns has a Third Steam music accompaniment played by a peculiar set of wheels, etc., in the bottom of the box.
The "man" in the title is present by implication.
In three of the big Guillery-Hogle sculptural pieces "listeners" in the form of mannequins are present.
And these, with one exception, are probably the least successful, most Pop Art-like works in the show.

The exception, Dilemma of the Silver Savior, includes a fantastic silver-colored figure who holds the skeleton of a silver umbrella and watches a silverized TV set with silver dollar-sign knobs.
The "Savior" sits watching a program of up and down graph-like line patterns.
Some of the TV sets play a fast kind of rock 'n' roll jazz that is the work of Guilleries band.
"Moe, Adrian and the Hatreds".

Others play Hogle's Cage like compositions.
To say the twenty-three Energy Sculptures owe a great deal to "Lumia" as well as to Pop Art and Abstract Expressionism, is saying nothing to their detriment.
The two very young men who designed and built these pieces have grown up and learned from the American art around them.
Using all that they have learned, they have managed to bring off a lively and interesting show.
